HasFingerprints
===============

Makes it easy to track who created/updated your models.

Example
=======

# Widget Schema...
create_table :widgets do |t|
  t.string :name
  t.fingerprints # creates integer fields for created_by and updated_by
end

# User model...
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_fingerprints
end

# Widget model...
class Widget < ActiveRecord::Base
  leaves_fingerprints

  # If your 'user' is really a Person you could do this:
  #
  # leaves_fingerprints :class_name => 'Person'
end

Now, some how, some way you need to set User.fingerprint to either the User instance
or User 'id' of the "currently logged in user".  One way to do this would be to put
this in your controller assuming your controller has a :current_user method that will
return the current user.

before_filter { |c| User.fingerprint = c.send(:current_user) }

At this point if you create/update a Widget it will set the created_by/updated_by attributes
automatically.  You can also do this:

@widget.creator => User instance...
@widget.updator => User instance...

The default :class_name is 'User' and can be overridden like this:

ActiveRecord::HasFingerprints::OPTIONS.merge!(:class_name => 'Person')
